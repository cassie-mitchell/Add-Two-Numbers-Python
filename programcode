number1 = input("Enter first number:")
# the input function takes a prompt as a parameter which it outputs to the console to prompt the user for input. The user input is stored in the variable number1

number2 = input("Enter second number:")
# get the second number

sum = float(number1) + float(number2)
# add the two variables and put them in the variable sum. As the variables donâ€™t have a type and the + only works on numbers, we have to state that the variables contain numbers (in this case floats)

print("The sum of these numbers is {0}".format(sum))
# print to console by returning a formatted string
